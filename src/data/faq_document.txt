To create an organization account in HRCare, visit the signup page and provide your organization’s legal name, billing contact, and relevant tax information. Designate an initial admin who will have full access to configure users, roles, integrations, and system-wide policies. Small teams can self-serve entirely online, completing all steps without assistance, while enterprise customers requiring SSO integration, sandbox testing, or migration of legacy data should contact Sales for guided support. Once the account is created, the admin can set default permissions, add users, configure approval workflows, and enforce compliance rules such as password policies, IP restrictions, and session timeout rules. Automated confirmation emails and detailed step-by-step instructions guide new admins through account setup. HRCare ensures seamless onboarding, secure access, and alignment with organizational policies. Admins also receive notifications for account activities and system updates, helping maintain oversight and compliance. This structured approach reduces errors, enhances security, and provides a smooth start for every organization.

HRCare provides advanced security controls to safeguard user accounts. Admins can define IP allowlists to restrict access to trusted networks, ensuring unauthorized connections are blocked. Device verification tracks devices used to access the system, requiring confirmation for new devices.

Detailed security activity logs record successful and failed login attempts, IP addresses, and device information to support auditing and compliance. Alerts notify admins of suspicious activities, including logins from unknown locations or repeated failed access attempts. Combining these controls helps organizations comply with internal security policies, regulatory requirements such as GDPR or ISO standards, and mitigates the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, and insider threats, while providing users with a secure and manageable experience.
